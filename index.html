    <h2><b>Pakistan and Islamabad:</b> A Glimpse into History</h2>
    <p>
      Pakistan and Islamabad: A Glimpse into History Pakistan, officially formed
      in 1947 after gaining independence from British rule, was the result of
      the tireless efforts of the Indian subcontinent's Muslims who sought a
      separate homeland. Under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan
      became a sovereign nation on August 14, 1947. Originally, Karachi served
      as the capital. However, in the 1960s, due to various reasons including
      its location and population growth, the government decided to build a new
      capital in a more central region. Islamabad was chosen for its strategic
      location, nestled at the foot of the Margalla Hills. It was designed as a
      modern and meticulously planned city by a Greek architect, Constantinos
      Apostolou Doxiadis, and construction began in the early 1960s. Islamabad
      represents Pakistan’s forward-thinking vision, symbolizing a blend of
      natural beauty and urban development. The city was officially made the
      capital of Pakistan in 1963. Today, it stands as a symbol of political,
      cultural, and economic progress. While Islamabad reflects modern Pakistan,
      it is also near the ancient city of Taxila, which dates back to over 3,000
      years and serves as a reminder of the region's deep historical roots. The
      city's landmarks, including the iconic Faisal Mosque, Pakistan Monument,
      and Daman-e-Koh, are significant to its history and culture. Islamabad
      continues to evolve as the political and administrative heart of the
      country, representing Pakistan's aspirations on both regional and global
      stages.
